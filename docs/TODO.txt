- Vertical profiles
- Longitudinal profiles
- Test multiple waterbodies
- Habitat volume
- Change card constructor to have numbers of records and fields.
    - Then read everything into a List<List<String>.
    - The other cards can then just parse the strings in to numeric and string variables, etc.


Parser To do:
- Add constructor to take in string or path
- Implement Builder pattern for W2Parameter
- Look at ProcessBuilder
- Look at adding getters for Cards or setters for fields
- Add save method once I add w2con as a field to the Parser
- Update methods?
- Add if block to init() method in each card to handle cases where there are no records and/or fields. See TributarySegmentCard.java.
